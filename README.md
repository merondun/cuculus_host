# Evolutionary Genomics of Host Specialization in Cuckoos

This project aims to investigate the evolutionary genomics underlying host specialization in common cuckoos. 

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **wgs_preprocessing**: Preparing fastq reads, alignment, initial SNP filtering, identifying relatives. 

- **snp_calling**: Calling SNPs from alignments, subsampling individuals. 

- **relatedness**: Identify related individuals. 

- **msmc**: Run MSMC crosscoalescent and MSMC-IM, using raw gVCFs with basic filtering for invariant sites. 

- **admixture**: Run ADMIXTURE and evalAdmix for plotting genetic tesselations across space.
