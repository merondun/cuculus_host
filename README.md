This project aims to investigate the evolutionary genomics underlying host specialization in common and oriental cuckoos. 

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **wgs_preprocessing**: Preparing fastq reads, alignment, initial SNP filtering, identifying relatives. 

- **phylogenetics**: Matrilineal trees, TWISST, BEAST, de novo mtDNA genomes (Fig 1 & 2). 

- **population_genetics**: ADMIXTURE and evalAdmix, plot tesselation and PCA (Fig 1). 

- **correlations_geography_genetics**: Associations between FST/PHIst and geographic distance (Fig. 1). 

- **gens_associations**: Associations between egg and explanatory variables: haplogroup, ancestry, geography (Fig. 2). 

- **gene_hunt**: Examining the genetic basis of egg mimicry using pairwise FST analyses (Fig. 3 & 4).
