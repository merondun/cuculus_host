# Evolutionary Genomics of Host Specialization in Cuckoos

This project aims to investigate the evolutionary genomics underlying host specialization in common cuckoos. 

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **wgs_preprocessing**: Preparing fastq reads, alignment, initial SNP filtering, identifying relatives. 

- **phylogenetics**: Calling SNPs from alignments, subsampling individuals. 

- **population_genetics**: Run ADMIXTURE and evalAdmix, plot tesselation and PCA. 

- **gens_associations**: Associations between egg or host or habitat and explanatory variables: haplogroup, ancestry, geography. 

- **correlations_geography_genetics**: Associations between FST/PHIst and geographic distance. 

- **gene_hunt**: Examining the genetic basis of egg mimicry using pairwise FST analyses.
